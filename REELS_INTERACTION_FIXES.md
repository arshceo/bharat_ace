# Reels Interaction Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Like Button Not Working**

- **Problem**: Like button wasn't showing correct state or updating counts
- **Fix**:
  - Added `initializeReelState()` method to fetch actual like status from database
  - Updated UI to show dynamic like count that reflects state changes
  - Added proper animations for like button interactions
  - Fixed double-tap to like functionality

### 2. **Follow Button Not Working**

- **Problem**: Follow button wasn't showing correct state or updating buddy counts
- **Fix**:
  - Added `initializeFollowState()` method to fetch actual follow status from database
  - Updated follow button text to show "Following" when already following
  - Added proper animations for follow button interactions
  - Connected to Supabase RPC functions for buddy count updates

### 3. **Comments Not Showing**

- **Problem**: Comments were being added but not displayed in the UI
- **Fix**:
  - Fixed the comments provider to use correct table join (`users` instead of `students`)
  - Added proper error handling and logging for comment operations
  - Improved comment input UI with better feedback
  - Added automatic refresh of comments list after adding new comment

### 4. **Dynamic Counts Not Updating**

- **Problem**: Like counts and buddy counts weren't updating in real-time
- **Fix**:
  - Implemented dynamic count calculation in UI based on state changes
  - Connected to Supabase RPC functions for atomic count updates
  - Added proper state management for interaction states

## Database Schema Verification

The Supabase schema includes all necessary tables and functions:

- ‚úÖ `reel_likes` table for storing like relationships
- ‚úÖ `follows` table for storing follow relationships
- ‚úÖ `comments` table for storing comments
- ‚úÖ RPC functions for atomic count updates:
  - `increment_reel_likes(reel_id)`
  - `decrement_reel_likes(reel_id)`
  - `increment_study_buddies(user_id)`
  - `decrement_study_buddies(user_id)`

## How to Test

### Using the App:

1. **Test Likes**:

   - Go to Reels screen
   - Tap the heart icon to like/unlike posts
   - Double-tap the video to like it
   - Check that the count updates and heart turns red when liked

2. **Test Follow**:

   - Go to Reels screen
   - Tap the follow button on other users' posts
   - Check that button changes to "Following" when followed
   - Verify buddy count updates in user profile

3. **Test Comments**:
   - Go to Reels screen
   - Tap the comment button to open comments sheet
   - Type a comment and press Enter or send button
   - Check that comment appears in the list immediately

### Using Test Screen:

1. Go to Home Screen
2. Tap "Reels Test" button (new option added)
3. Enter Reel ID and User ID for testing
4. Use test buttons to check individual functionality
5. Monitor test results for debugging

## Key Code Changes

### ReelsInteractionProvider (`lib/core/providers/reels_interaction_provider.dart`):

- Added `initializeReelState()` and `initializeFollowState()` methods
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### ReelsScreen (`lib/screens/reels/reels_screen.dart`):

- Added state initialization on reel item build
- Enhanced action buttons with proper animations
- Fixed comment provider to use correct table structure
- Improved comment input with better UX
- Added dynamic like count calculation

### Routes (`lib/common/routes.dart`):

- Added route for test screen

### Home Screen (`lib/screens/home_screen/home_screen2.dart`):

- Added quick access button to test screen

## Testing the Database Integration

To verify the database integration is working:

1. **Check Supabase Dashboard**:

   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Check the `reel_likes`, `follows`, and `comments` tables
   - Verify data is being inserted/deleted correctly

2. **Monitor Console Logs**:

   - Check Flutter console for success/error messages
   - Look for logs starting with üé¨, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå emojis

3. **Use Test Screen**:
   - Navigate to the test screen from home
   - Test individual functions with real IDs
   - Monitor results for debugging

## Expected Behavior

After these fixes:

- ‚úÖ Like buttons animate and show correct state (red when liked)
- ‚úÖ Like counts update dynamically (+1 when liked, -1 when unliked)
- ‚úÖ Follow buttons show "Follow" or "Following" correctly
- ‚úÖ Comments appear immediately after posting
- ‚úÖ All interactions are persistent (survive app restart)
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates reflect in user profiles and stats

## Next Steps

If issues persist:

1. Check Supabase connection and authentication
2. Verify user has proper permissions in database
3. Use the test screen to isolate specific problems
4. Check console logs for detailed error messages
5. Verify the current user ID is being retrieved correctly
