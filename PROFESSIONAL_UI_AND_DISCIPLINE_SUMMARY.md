## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Instructions

### For Students:

1. **Study Timer**: Automatically tracks time spent on each screen
2. **Break Reminders**: Gentle reminders every 25 minutes with motivational messages
3. **Discipline Mode**: 4-hour focused study sessions with restrictions
4. **Emergency Break**: Available but requires parent password

### For Parents:

1. **Password Configuration**: Set password in `EmergencyBreakDialog._parentPassword`
2. **Emergency Access**: Use password to grant immediate breaks when needed
3. **Monitoring**: View session and screen times in AppBar

### For Developers:

1. **Wrapping Screens**: Use `DisciplineWrapper` around topic detail screens
2. **Timer Integration**: Add `TimerAppBarWidget` to any screen's AppBar
3. **Professional Cards**: Use `ProfessionalCard` widget for consistent styling

## ðŸ”„ How the Discipline System Works

1. **Session Start**: Timer begins when app launches
2. **Screen Tracking**: Each screen's time is monitored individually
3. **Break Intervals**: Every 25 minutes on topic detail screens, show break dialog
4. **Break Options**:
   - Take 5-minute break â†’ Timer pauses, break screen shows
   - Skip break â†’ Time accumulates for later (e.g., 3 skips = 15 min accumulated)
5. **4-Hour Limit**: After 4 hours, all restrictions lift automatically
6. **Emergency Break**: Parent password allows immediate break override

## ðŸŽ¨ Professional Card Examples

All cards now use:

```dart
ProfessionalCard(
  child: YourContent(),
  onTap: YourTapHandler(), // Optional
)
```

Results in:

- White background
- 1.5px gray border
- Subtle shadow
- Black text
- Consistent padding
- Professional appearance

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Topic Detail Integration**: Apply `DisciplineWrapper` to existing topic detail screens
2. **Password Configuration**: Create UI for parents to set their password
3. **Break Customization**: Allow customization of break intervals and duration
4. **Analytics**: Add tracking for study efficiency and break patterns
5. **Notifications**: Implement system notifications for break reminders
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of discipline system edge cases

The system is now fully functional with professional styling and a comprehensive discipline system that encourages healthy study habits while maintaining focus during study sessions.
